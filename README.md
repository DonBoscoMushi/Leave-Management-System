## INTRODUCTION
At some point in our lives we may need to ask for a permit or to request a leave of absence from work. The leave permission maybe for a number of reasons such as a doctorâ€™s appointment, vacation, health issues (illness), family issues, loss of loved ones, birth of a child, relief from excessive job and other more reasons. Afterall we are all humans. The aim of this project is to create a leave management system for university of Dar Es Salaam that can be used by both students and staff that will help to clear any mis confusion of the validity of any leave. 

The primary objective of the proposed Leave Management System is to ensure the administration of standard leave policies, centralize the collection and maintenance of leave records, and automate as much of the process as possible. This system allows creating, monitoring, and routing of the leave applications from the applicants to the acting supervisors in the department and to the administrator of the Human Resources Department.
