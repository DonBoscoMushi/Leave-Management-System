# Leave-Management-System

The primary objective of the proposed Leave Management System is to ensure the administration of standard leave policies, centralize the collection and maintenance of leave records, and automate as much of the process as possible. This system allows creating, monitoring, and routing of the leave applications from the applicants to the acting supervisors in the department and to the administrator of the Human Resources Department.
